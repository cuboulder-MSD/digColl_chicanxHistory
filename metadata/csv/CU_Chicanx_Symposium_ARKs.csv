Pulling heavily on resources provided by community members and CU Boulder’s Latino History Project, this presentation explores how K-12 educators can utilize murals, music and testimonio to explore these stories in authentic and transformative manner that serves to empower students despite the violence and repression illustrated through these stories. Specifically, Romero will analyze the mural of Los Seis from artist Pedro Romero that once was painted on the walls of the UMC, Augustine Cordova’s “Corrido de Los Seis,” Heriberto Teran’s poem, “Aztlán esta de Luto,” and the narratives of the martyrs included in a May 2014 special edition of La Cucaracha newspaper. Connections to Colorado Chicana/o/x communities, Colorado Academic Standards and multiple content areas will be named and explored. “Los Seis de Boulder: Insurgent Scholar-Activists and the Radical Pedagogies of a Usable Past."" Presented by Daniel Salcido (community activist, educator, and organizer).This presentation addresses how research methodologies such as oral histories, community newspapers and testimonio, and archival research - artifacts of a “usable past” - can expand the narrative of the Chicano Movement in Colorado beyond the violent deaths of Los Seis de Boulder. Such scholarship fills in the “blank spots” in the historical experience of the Chicanx community in Colorado, uncovering radical pedagogies of activism that are intertwined with the solidarity networks of other oppressed nationalities from third-world radical and leftist groups. They produce counter-memories of and eulogies to organized political expression that extend into current movements and struggles for social justice, such as the student disappearances of Ayotzinapa.
